# Recommended PCB Design Rules

These rules are not required, but establishing a consistent standard improves
manufacturing reliability and consistency.

## Naming 

- Basic Capacitors, Inductors, and Resistors must be named unitless
    Example: 10u, 10k, 10p
- Component values must be equal to or greater than 1, and must be a decimal
    Example: 10.1k, 10.5p
- Extended Capacitors, Inductors, and Resistors must be given the manufacturer name
- Inductors, Ferrite beads, and common-mode chokes must be labeled with the L designator
- Transformers must be labeled with the T designator
- Crystals must be labeled with the Y designator

## Allowed Components

- Through-hole components must be used only for connectors
- 1u and less capacitors must be 0402, 22u and less must be 0603 unless high voltage
- Resistors must be 0603 unless size-contrained
- All extended components must be justified
