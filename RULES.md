# PCB Design Rules

Note: These rules are not required to use JCAD, but they are my personal rules to
ensure simple manufacturability.

1. Through-hole components are allowed only for connectors
2. 1uf and less capacitors must be 0402, 22uf and less must be 0603 unless HV
3. Resistors must be 0603 unless size-contrained
4. Every extended component must be justified
5. Inductors, Ferrite beads, and common-mode chokes are labeled with the L designator
6. Transformers are labeled with the T designator
7. Crystals are labeled with the Y designator
